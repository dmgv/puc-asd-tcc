>So you all know the web is the world most successful application delivery system and it has reached everywhere mainly because of the efforts of a lot of extremely clever people who found ways to make it work despite the fact that was not designed to be an application delivery system, it was intended to be a document retrieval system worked well for that wasn't intended to do virtually everything else that we're doing and we're a doing it anyway but it is hard it is much harder than it should be. 

>Web developers spend most of their time doing workarounds trying to get around design limitations and errors in the architecture, not spending time adding value so it's a very frustrating environment to do development it's an extremely complex thing because again it wasn't designed to do what it needed to do. More standards and features have been added over the years often without a lot of clarity to where the thigs was actually going to be going and how it was going to be used so it's really complicated and standards cannot reduce the complexity of the web, standards can only increase its complexity by adding more and more stuff to it and all of that results in high cost of development it is much too hard and risky create web applications we really need it to be easier 

>But the biggest problem with the web is its insecurity we have a large set of security exploits cross-site scripting attacks, XSRF attacks, clickjacking all that stuff and also the Web is dependent on passwords and passwords
